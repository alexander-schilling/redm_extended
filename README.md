redm_extended is a roleplay framework for RedM, original code is from es_extended based on FiveM. The to-go framework for creating an economy based roleplay server on RedM!
This fork is customized to fit some of the changes that I've made, like multi-character support, and merging some functions made by different projects.

ESX was initially developed by Gizz back in 2017, later on developed and improved by ESX-Org.
All credits go to ESX-Org for all the work they had in the original framework (es_extended).
RDX was initially developed by ThymonA.
All credits go to him for the work made in this custom frawework for RedM.
extendedmode is a community edition fork of es_extended (better known as ESX) and is maintained by various trusted members of the FiveM community.
Some of the changes made are included in this fork, all the credits go to them.
RedEM: Roleplay is an Advanced roleplay framework for RedEM developed by amakuu and kanersps.
Some functions and natives implementations are from that project, all credits go to them.
